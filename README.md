•	Spyder: Installed through the Anaconda Enviorment
•	Pytorch: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
•	(If GPU use `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia`)
•	(If CPU use `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch`)
•	FashionMnist Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist
